# 🚀 PingMe – Chat Application 

PingMe is a **real time chat application** inspired by modern messaging platforms like **WhatsApp and Instagram DMs**.

The project is being developed with a **backend-first approach**, focusing initially on building a **scalable, secure, and real-time messaging backend** using **Django, Django REST Framework, and Django Channels**.  
A modern frontend (React / Next.js) will be integrated in upcoming phases.

PingMe is designed as a **learning-driven yet production-oriented project**, aiming to cover real world system design, authentication, WebSockets, and async backend patterns.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication
- JWT authentication using SimpleJWT
- Custom JWT middleware for WebSocket authentication
- Secure user handling inside WebSocket scope

### 💬 Real-Time Messaging
- WebSocket-based real-time chat
- Thread-based 1-to-1 chat system
- Redis-backed Django Channels
- Messages broadcasted to all users in a thread

### 🧵 Chat System
- Thread model for conversations
- Message model with:
  - sender
  - timestamp
  - read status
  - attachment support (planned)
- Messages stored in database

### 🔄 REST + WebSocket Hybrid
- REST APIs for:
  - User registration & login
  - Thread creation
  - Message history
- WebSockets for:
  - Live message delivery

### 🧪 Testing
- WebSocket tested using `websocat`
- JWT tokens tested manually
- Redis & Channels verified
